<!-- HTML Entities :

Some characters are reserved in HTML.

If you use the less than (<) or greater than (>) signs in your HTML text, the browser might mix them with tags.

Entity names or entity numbers can be used to display reserved HTML characters.

Entity names look like this:

&entity_name;
Entity numbers look like this:

&#entity_number;
To display a less than sign (<) we must write: &lt; or &#60;
